# ToDo List Frontend Project ✅

Welcome to the **ToDo List** frontend project! 📝 This web application allows you to easily manage your tasks and to-do items right in your browser. Built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project provides a simple yet efficient way to keep track of your tasks. Let's dive into the features and functionalities of this application. 🚀

## Features 🌟

- **Add New Items**: You can add new tasks to your list by typing in the input field and pressing the "Add Item" button. This will add the task to your list, and it will be stored locally in your browser's localStorage. ➕

- **Update Items**: If you need to make changes to a task, such as modifying its name, you can do so by clicking on the task you want to update. This will allow you to make edits and save the changes. 📝✏️

- **Delete Items**: Completed a task or no longer need it? No problem! You can delete tasks from your list by clicking on the ❌ icon next to the task or if you need to delete everything, just click "Clear All" button removes all of your tasks. 🗑️

- **Filter Items**: Stay organized by using the filter feature. You can filter tasks based on their status, such as completed or active, making it easier to focus on specific tasks. 🔍

- **Persistent Storage**: All your tasks are stored in your browser's localStorage. This means that even if you close the browser or the session, your tasks will be retained until you manually update or delete them. 💾
